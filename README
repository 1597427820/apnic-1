Apnic: IP Region Querier For Go Language

This library provides a fast IP region querier for Go language.
It implements an O(logN) querier which uses binary search
instead of sequential search to detect if a given IP lives in 
a region.

The region data is generated from the public information provided
by apnic.net, and the process is automated by a Makefile.

Usage:

	import "github.com/microfoxme/apnic"

	...
	if !apnic.IPInPRC(ip) {
		// do something to make sure you can access
		// the destination address.
		...
	}

Hacks:

	$ make && go install

The command is enough to generate the Go source file and installs
the package in GOPATH.

	$ make ipnet-cn.json

This will generate a pre-sorted file 'ipnet-cn.json' in JSON format.
By translating the function, apnic.Map.Contains, into javascript,
you can use this library in the browser.
